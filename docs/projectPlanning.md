Project Description:

Cafe 99 sells a wide daily selection of beverages and baked products that are available to order online via our e-commerce site. We have a philosophy of invention â€” an invention of new technologies, of different ingredients and flavors with passion and skill.

The project is based on APIs for Users, Cart Items, Orders, Items. To place an order at Cafe99 online, the user must either login or create an account. Upon signing in, the user can order items from the menu, and add to cart.

Menu functionality:

- Create a user account
- Delete account
- Login to account
- Look at Menu
- Add items to cart
- Search for menu items

Pull request style:

- Everyone works on different development branches or main branch and merge together.

License:

- The existing GPL-3.0 license will be sufficient for this project
